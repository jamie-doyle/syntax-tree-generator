# Syntax Tree Generator
The code portion of my disseration, "The Generation of Sequential Programs from Abstract Syntax Trees", submitted as part of the requirements of the BEng Computer Science course at Queen's University Belfast (June 2016).

The program reads XML files containing an abstract representation of a program, converting this representation to a series of node objects internally, then using these to produce code in C#. Examples are included in the `SyntaxTreeGen/XML/Examples` directory, some of which are adapted from Deitel & Deitel's *C# 2012 for Programmers*.

The program could easily be extended to produce output in other languages, or represent other language constructs, particularly another OO langauge.
